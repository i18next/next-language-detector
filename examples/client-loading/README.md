# Static internationalized (i18n) next.js website with the help of [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) and [next-language-detector](https://github.com/i18next/next-language-detector)

## What is this?

This is a simple example of how to use [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for a complete static website and the use of [locize](https://locize.com) to get translations up and running quickly and easily.

We will use the [i18next-locize-backend plugin](https://github.com/locize/i18next-locize-backend) only on client side.

Instead on server side we'll "bundle" the translations first.
See [downloadLocales script in package.json](https://github.com/i18next/next-language-detector/blob/main/examples/client-loading/package.json#L15) and the bundle them together with our generated website.

Before "deploying" your app, you can run the [downloadLocales script](https://github.com/i18next/next-language-detector/blob/main/examples/client-loading/package.json#L15) (or similar), which will use the [cli](https://github.com/locize/locize-cli) to download the translations from locize into the appropriate folder next-i18next is looking in to (i.e. ./public/locales).
This way the translations are bundled in your app and on server side you will not generate any downloads to the [locize CDN](https://www.locize.com/docs/cdn-content-delivery-network) during runtime, but just on client side.

## Verify yourself

To prove that this works, pull this example to your local machine and run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
npm run serve
```

and open your browser at http://localhost:8080

You can now deploy the out folder to any static webserver, like [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
